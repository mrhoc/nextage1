== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to assign new colour? =

Open the page to edit tags or categories and change the colour in the column "Color".

= How does intelligent colour selection work? =

The plugin does check if the category name contains one of the keywords and sets the pre-defined colour for this category.
For example, a category that contains Facebook will be coloured to a dark blue colour.

= How to get a colour for a specific category? =

Use Wordpress default function: get_term_meta($term_id, 'cc_color', true);
